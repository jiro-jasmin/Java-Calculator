# Java Calculator 🧮️

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is a simple calculator made with Java.
 
It can handle all four basic operations between two (positive or negative) numbers, with some "delete" (remove one character) and "clear (remove all characters) features.
 
I am currently trying to expand my skills by learning new languages.
